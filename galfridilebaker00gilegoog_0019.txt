Seven years of almost unremitting labour has enabled the Editor to
complete more than one half of his undertaking. In order in some mea·
sure to lighten the burden of so heavy a task which hasbeen carried on
by him, totally unaided by either Publishers or literary societies, and to
give the public a reasonable hope that it will be brought to 3 successful
termination‚ ithae been deenred advisable to give the text only of each
author, reserving the concluding volume or volumes for all such historical

discussions, notes, chronological tables, indices, and other matter, as may
serve to give unity to this comprehensive and national publication.

Ἴ It is confidently believed, that uo single fragment of the remains of these
ἱ writers will be found to remain in MS. which the Editor has not either

ἱ included in this edition, or at least given good reason for having omitted it.

p Two hundred and fifty copies will be printed. Subscribers’ names for
the works of PETER OF BLOIS will be received by the Editor; by

. Mr. Parker, Ocsord ; Messrs. Deipbtoa end Soa, Cambridge ; and by all

Booksellers.
